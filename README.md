## ALX Listing App
Alx listing app is a clone of the airbnb listing app. This app helps users to list available rentals so as to be able to book anyone that suits them.

## Project Objective
This project focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, thee project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Project Structure
The proect files are classified in folders based on each file's purpose. Files having common usage are placed in the same folders, and files unique in purpose are just stored in the root directory. Some generally used folders are 

# components:
Used to store reusable components

# interface:
Used for declaring TypeScript interfaces related to the project

# constants: 
Used to setup constant that store any reusable data or string such as API URLs, cofiguration dettings, or UI text

# public/assets
Stores all necessary images and SVG files that will be used across the project.




## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
